# Who made the project possible?

**Technical support**

Lawrence Evalyn is the Text Mining Specialist at Research Data Services at Northeastern University Library. Lawrence has been an indispensable resource in helping me with coding using Python and spaCy. Despite the amount of obstacles in the course of our co-coding sessions, Lawrence helped me built confidence in my abilities to code and experiment with different techniques. 


**Scholarly support**

This project would not be possible without the support of my advisor Erina Megowan. Dr. Megowan has been advising my comprehensive exam list on the history of Russian Empire, Early Soviet Union, and ethnic minorities who lived across both political spaces. After starting the current project, Dr. Megowan agreed to give me contextual and user feedback, particularly on the primary source, along with the historical, political and social context. This support has been critical in making sense of the information contained in the brochure, The Female Worker of the East, but helped me identify contextual questions pertaining to data has was intentionally left our of the publication.
