## Context on the analysis ##

To Frame the analysis and subsequent findings of the current project I relied on the key approaches in the [Topic Modeling Martha Ballard's Diary](https://cblevins.github.io/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/) project by Cameron Blevins, and discussion points from the article "ВООБРАЖАЯ СОВЕТСКИЙ ВОСТОК: НАРРАТИВЫ ПОПУЛЯРНОЙ ЭТНОГРАФИИ В СЕРИИ БРОШЮР «ТРУЖЕНИЦА ВОСТОКА», 1927-1929" [Imagining the Narratives of the Soviet East: Popular Ethnography in the Female Worker of the East brochure series](https://journal.kunstkamera.ru/archive/2024_nomer_2_24/chernyaeva_n_a_povtornoe_ispolzovanie_etnograficheskoj_fotografii_i_rezhimy_vizualizacii_etnichnosti_na_primere_fotografii_iz_ko) by Natalya Anatolyevna Chernyaeva (Наталья Анатольевна Черняева). 

Chernyaeva's article is one of the only existing academic articles that focuses on this particular publication. I was surprised by how a publication which contained such demeaning and derogatory language about people could be allowed for print, in a state that prided itself as antiracist and antiimperial.  

>"The brochures activated an apparatus of cultural hegemony, contributing to identification of the reader with the civilized and the representatives of other nations backwardness."[^1] 

However, learning more about the nationality politics, gender questions, and the experiences of selected communities accross Soviet Union helped me better understand the authors of this publication. Along with Natalya Chernyaeva's article, Gregory Massell, Marianna Kamp, Adeeb Khalid's works primarily on the Muslim communities of Central Asia provided historical context for this project.

## Analysis ##

One of the most important decisions that needs to be made before conducting a topic modeling analysis is to decide an optimal number of topics. Most researchers suggest experimenting with different numbers to evaluate the quality of topic outputs. On one hand, analyzing larger data sets with a low number of topics can result in topics that are too general, missing out on the granularity of the data. On the other hand, using too many topics will generate outputs with topics that are too rare and non-representative. 

For the current analysis, I experimented with 10, 30, 50 and 100 topics. The outputs generated using 10 and 30 topics were more interesting than those of 50 and 100. For this reason, the analysis in the findings file includes excerpts from using 10 and 30 topics. 

See the static images of 10 and 30 topics here:
