# The Female Worker of the East

**About analysis**

To Frame the analysis and subsequent findings of the current project I relied on the key approaches in the "Topic Modeling Martha Ballard's Diary" project by Cameron Blevins, and discussion points reflected in the article "ВООБРАЖАЯ СОВЕТСКИЙ ВОСТОК: НАРРАТИВЫ ПОПУЛЯРНОЙ ЭТНОГРАФИИ В СЕРИИ БРОШЮР «ТРУЖЕНИЦА ВОСТОКА», 1927-1929" ("Imagining the Narratives of the Soviet East: Popular Ethnography in the Female Worker of the East brochure series) by Наталья Анатольевна Черняева (Natalya Anatolyevna Chernyaeva).

From Blevins, I borrowed the following questions:
-> What are the possible advantages of using topic modeling with a small corpus?
-> What are the common topics? 
-> To what extent did I expect this topic to appear in the model and why?
-> What did I expect to see and didn't see? 

From Chernyaeva, the following concepts and observations:


**Method and its limitations**
-> Topic modeling as a tool was designed to be utilized for analyzing large datasets, manual analysis of which would be too timely for human engagement. Therefore, using this tool against a relatively small corpus is uncommon. 
-> Despite the fact that the model is supposed to ignore the meaning of the word, prioritizing its likeliness to occur in proximity with other similar words, some important words were missed.


**Lessons learned and Opportunities**
